The Movie Project script takes a list of movies and turns them into an interactive webpage that displays the movie's poster and trailer.

To use the script Python 2.7 needs to be installed on the system which can be done at: 
www.Python.org/downloads/ (other versions of python may work but have not been tested)

Once python is installed open the IDLE development environment.

At the top of the shell hit "File>>>Open...", navigate to the MovieProject folder on your system and open entertainment_center.py.  Run the file by hitting F5 or clicking "Run>>>Run Module".

If python is properly installed a webpage will open which displays six movies.  By clicking on the posters a description and movie trailer pops up.

When you execute the entertainment_center module it creates movie instances using the Movie module and then sends the Movies to fresh_tomatoes.py which takes the movie classes and turns them into an interactive webpage.
